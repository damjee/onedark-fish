# One Dark colors for [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)

## Overview
Forked version of https://github.com/woheedev/onedark-fish. I like the onedark colors but the purple and red being assigned to so many things made it hard to distinguish an error from something valid. I also made the autosuggestion match the comment color.

## Installation

Install themes with [`fisher`](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```sh
fisher install damjee/onedark-fish
```

Choose the theme:

```sh
fish_config theme save "One Dark"
```

## Credits

All colors were taken from [the repo](https://github.com/rkbk60/onedark-fish).
